# E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)  

Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! This project is part of the **Follow Along Project: Milestone 1**, where we will learn to build a full-fledged e-commerce application from scratch using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools. By the end of this project, you will have a functional e-commerce application with features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.  

## Learning Goals 
Understand the overall structure of a MERN stack project.  
Set up a new project repository and initialize it effectively.  
Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.  
Learn the foundational steps of backend development, database schema design, and REST API creation.  

## Key Features  
1. **MERN Stack:** A JavaScript-only approach for full-stack development.  
2. **REST API Creation:** Scalable endpoints for user authentication, product management, and order handling.  
3. **Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionalities.  
4. **Database Schema Design:** Structured data models using MongoDB.  
5. **Backend Development:** Robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.  
6. **Frontend:** React for building a dynamic and user-friendly interface.  

## Milestone 1 Overview  
**Introduction to the MERN Stack:** Understanding the technologies and how they work together.  
**REST API Structure:** Building endpoints for essential features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.  
**Database Schema Design:** Creating well-structured data models in MongoDB.  
**Authentication:** Learning the role of authentication in web applications and implementing it.

## Milestone 2:
Project Structure and Login Page


Created a structured folder hierarchy for separating frontend and backend code.

Set up the React application for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend.

Configured Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.

Developed a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

Outcome: Project was structured, and the first user-facing feature (Login Page) was implemented.

## Milestone 3:
Backend Setup and Database Connection


Created a dedicated folder structure for organizing backend code (routes, controllers, models, etc.).

Configured a Node.js server with Express.js to handle API requests.

Connected the backend to MongoDB for data storage.

Implemented basic error handling for better debugging.

Outcome: Backend setup was completed with MongoDB integration, making the application ready for further development.

## Milestone 4:
User Model, Controller, and File Uploads


Designed the User Model with a schema defining user details (e.g., name, email, password).

Developed the User Controller to manage user data operations like adding or fetching users.

Integrated Multer to enable file uploads (e.g., profile pictures) and store them in the backend.

Outcome: Backend was enhanced with user management capabilities and support for file uploads.
