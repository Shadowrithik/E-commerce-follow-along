# E-commerce-follow-along
## Overview
This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the **MERN Stack**. It offers a hands-on experience with building scalable, secure, and interactive web applications. 
Through mentor-guided sessions, you will learn to develop both front-end and back-end features, implement secure authentication, and design robust database schemas.

## Key Features of the Project  

### 1. MERN Stack Development  
- Learn to utilize the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to build a fully functional e-commerce application.  
- Gain insights into the **JavaScript-only approach**, allowing you to use a single programming language across the entire stack.  

### 2. REST API Creation  
- Develop scalable and efficient **REST APIs** to handle key operations, including:  
  - **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration.  
  - **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product details.  
  - **Order Handling**: Manage customer orders and transactions.  
- Use standard HTTP methods and serve data in a structured JSON format.  

### 3. Authentication  
- Learn to implement **secure authentication mechanisms**, ensuring data privacy and protecting user information.  
- Explore authentication techniques to verify user identity and control access to sensitive resources.  

### 4. Database Schema Design  
- Design and structure data models using **MongoDB** for storing user, product, and order data.  
- Optimize schema design to ensure efficiency and scalability.  

### 5. Backend Development  
- Set up robust server-side logic using **Node.js** and **Express**.  
- Build APIs that integrate seamlessly with the front-end, ensuring smooth user experiences.  

### 6. Frontend with React  
- Use your existing knowledge of **React** to develop a responsive and intuitive user interface.  
- Implement features like product browsing, cart management, and order placement.

### 2. REST API Structure and Endpoints  
- Explore the architecture of **REST APIs** and how to design endpoints for:  
  - **User Authentication**: Register and log in users.  
  - **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product data.  
  - **Order Handling**: Manage customer orders.  
- Learn how APIs interact with the database to serve data in JSON format.  

### 3. Basics of Database Schema Design  
- Understand the principles of schema design in **MongoDB**, including data structure and relationships.  
- Learn to optimize your schema for performance and scalability.  

### 4. Role of Authentication in Web Applications  
- Discover how authentication ensures secure access to sensitive resources.  
- Implement user authentication features, including registration, login, and access control.
